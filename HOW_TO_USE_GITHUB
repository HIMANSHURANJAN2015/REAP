HOW TO USE GITHUB :-
------------------------

Suppose u want to improve the ui of student,then follow these steps. For other cases also we work in similaer fashion

1) First clone the master in local repo
	git clone https://github.com/HIMANSHURANJAN2015/REAP.git

  if u already have it in your local repository, then no need of cloning ,( just do git pull)
   i) git checkout master 
   ii) git pull

2) now create a different branch from master, where u will write the code to improve student ui
   i) git checkout -b studentUiModifications    
         here  studentUiModifications is the name of our new file

3) start working on it.

4) after finishing the task do, 
     i) git status    		(This will show all the files that u have created/ modified/deleted etc.)
     ii) git diff filename	(This is a good practice to have a look at all the modifed lines, so that u do not aler others code, even a minor changes is trated as a different line in git.)
     iii) git add filename

     OR do
     iv)  git add *          (This wil add all the lines to staged area( Those files which will be added in the next commit)
     v) git status			 (To see if all files are taken care of)

5) git commit -m "Improved the ui of student dashboard"
	This will comit the changes to your local repo, but  not to online

6) This is not needed, but we may need if al 3 are working on same files...
	i) git checkout master  (Switched to master branch of your local repo)
	ii) git pull			 (This will fetch the latest code of master that have been merged online by other teammates)
	iii) git chekout studentUiModifications	(Switch back to your branch)
	iv) git merge master	(To merge latest master in our branch...if there is any merge conflicts..then we remove manually those ambiguity by keeing the lines which we wish to keep)
	v) git commit -m "REsolve merged conflicts"

7) Now Your branch studentUiModifications has all the latest code of master plus your code

8) git push -u origin studentUiModifications (This pushes your code to online)
	This will not be merged in master, but it will be saved as a different filename

9) not to merge, u need to contact the owner by sending him pull requests,
  From github website, create a pull requests, write description if required, and attach my name(himanshuranhan2015 in the list of reviewers)
   This way we will look at each other code(actually the benefit is we will see the diffence , hence we can easily figure out what code u have written)

10) Finally the reviewer will see and merge the pull requests to master

Now your master will have the latest code from others as well as studentUiModifications


Next timw when u do git pull form master, u can see your code also coming...as it have been merged :D :D
