Recognition and extraction of answer parts

Plan:
To build a prototype that takes a scanned copy of answer scripts as input, extracts answer images from it, question wise and saves it at some location. Now there are 3 roles- evaluator, student and admin. Each of them has different tasks to perform.
The evaluator can login through his portal ad evaluate the answers,give any comments if he/she wants and see the challenged scripts( challenged by student).
The student can login through his portal and see his answers, marks, comments as well as as challenge the evaluator if they think that they have got less marks.
Admin has its own set of tasks like asigning bundles(collection of images) to evaluator, and many other such things.

Benefits :
It eliminates the need to flip through several pages to find the answer for a particular question. 
Professor can compare answers of all students.
Speeds up the evaluation process.
Makes professorâ€™s life easy.

2) apache server
3) mysql
4) phpmyadmin
5) bootstrap framework
6) jquery
